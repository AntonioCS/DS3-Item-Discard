NOTE: Creating a game back-up before you use any version of this program is highly recommended

[Which Version Should I Use?]
(UPDATE NOTE: VERSION 1.0.1 Also Added A Feature That Lets You See And Delete Items Recently Added To Your Inventory [DLL VERSION ONLY])

The DLL version of the program is highly recommended as it has an additional feature that the console version of the program doesn't have which allows you to automatically scan for invalid items and delete them through the program. If the DLL version of the program doesn't work, then use of the Console Program is recommended, but if you don't want to use either version of the program then you can use the scripts in the "CE Scripts" folder with the program "Cheat Engine" to allow you to delete items or scan your inventory. 

[How To Use The DLL Version]
(NOTE: If You Forget What Items A Hacker Gave You, You Can Use Option 3 In The Program And It Tell You Items That Were Recently Added To Your Inventory.)

1. Make sure your game is completely closed out
2. Navigate to your game directory (example location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game)
3. Put the "dinput8.dll" file into your game directory
4. Start the game and load into the character that you want to discard an item on
5. Type "1" in the console window and wait for it to patch the game params, after it is done you can press any key to return to the program menu.
6. Go into your inventory and check if you can discard the item that you want to discard, discard it if option is available
7. If you can't discard the item or want to scan your inventory for invalid items, then you can type "2" into the console menu to check if you have any invalid items in your inventory
8. Type "y" if you wish to scan your inventory after reading the disclaimer and if any invalid items are detected then you can type "y" to have the program automatically delete them (if you wish not to scan or delete the invalid items, then you can type "n" to go back to the main menu).
9. Once you are done using the program, type "3" in the main menu and close the console window and close your DS3 game window when once your game has autosaved the changes
10. Re-navigate to your DS3 folder and remove the "dinput8.dll" file from your game directory (or rename it if you'd like to keep it for future use).
11. Re-open your game and make sure the item was deleted successfully, if it was then you can delete the program or keep it for use again if necessary

[How To Use The Console Version]
1. Open up Dark Souls 3
2. Start the console program and make sure it finds the game correctly (it should display a menu if it does)
3. Log into the character that you want to discard an item on
4. Type "1" in the console window and wait for it to patch the game params, after it is done you can press any key to return to the program menu (this may take a few seconds with the Console Version of the program).
5. Go into your inventory and check if you can discard the item that you want to discard, discard it if option is available
6. If you can't discard the item, then you may want to switch to the DLL version of the program, or use the "Invalid Item Scan And Delete" script in Cheat Engine to see if you can delete the item that way (if you still can't then you may have encountered a bug)
7. Once you are done using the program, type "3" in the main menu and close the console window and close your DS3 game window when once your game has autosaved the changes
8. Re-open your game and make sure the item was deleted successfully, if it was then you can delete the program or keep it for use again if necessary

[How To Use The CE Scripts]
1. Open the "Cheat Engine" program (install it if you don't already have it)
2. Click on the computer icon in the top left corner and select the DS3 process and open it in CE
3. Open up the .txt file for the script that you want to use and press CTRL+A and CTRL+C in that file (copy all text)
4. Right click under the "Active|Description|Address..." bar and select paste
5. Check mark the box to run the script that you added to cheat engine, you can close the program once you are done (if the box won't check mark then make sure that you have the Dark Souls III process opened properly in Cheat Engine)
6. If you're trying to use the "(Requires PT) PP All Item Discard.txt" script then you need the public cheat table for DS3 and you have to enable "Param Patcher v2.0.5"
